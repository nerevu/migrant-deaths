methodology,"Missing Migrants Project draws on a range of sources to track deaths of migrants along migratory routes across the globe. Data from this project are published in the report “Fatal Journeys: Tracking Lives Lost during Migration,” which provides the most comprehensive global tally of migrant fatalities for 2014, and estimates deaths over the past 15 years.
With a count surpassing 40,000 fatalities since 2000, IOM calls on all the world’s governments to address what it describes as “an epidemic of crime and victimization.”
“Our message is blunt: migrants are dying who need not,” said IOM Director General William Lacy Swing, “It is time to do more than count the number of dead. It is time to engage the world to stop this violence against desperate migrants.”
The research behind this project began with the October 2013 tragedies, when over 400 migrants died in two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa. IOM’s research indicates Europe is the world’s most dangerous destination for “irregular” migrants, with the Mediterranean costing the lives of over 3,600 this year. Around the world, over 5,000 migrants lost their lives in 2014. Approximately 5,000 are known to have died around the world in the first eleven months of 2015. Many more are unaccounted for."
